# Hospital-Triage-Expert-System
This project implements a Rule-Based Expert System using Python to automate the critical initial decision-making process in a hospital's Emergency Department (ED). The system mimics the judgmental knowledge of a senior triage nurse or physician, translating established medical protocols  into explicit IF-THEN rules.
